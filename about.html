    <h2>About Us</h2>
	<p>Here at CinnaWoman, our original passion was centered on a single food: the cinnamon bun. We took a classic recipe and wondered how it might be made <br>
	better, how it might have better texture, greater balance, improved ingredients, and improved taste. And thus, through our hard labor and imagination, the cinnamon <br>
	roll was improved. </p>
	
	<p>Due to this expansion of our vision, the expansion of our menu was a direct consequence. Hence, we now started trying out new and different combinations of <br>
	ingredients in order to still be roots-based while being innovative at the same time. In this manner, the present dessert menu of CinnaWoman now consists of <br>
	a rotation menu of over 16 different desserts, each one of which now takes as long as our regular buns. </p>
	
	<p> What connects all of these desserts is that they each have a specific intention. Our dishes are designed, developed, and worked on until they reach <br>
	a level that satisfies us. This involves a balance between aspects like sweet and rich, soft and textured, traditional and innovative. It is a scenario <br>
	where we aim at presenting a dessert service that provides meaning through every single dessert that people order from us. </p>
