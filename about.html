    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>CinnaWoman began with one vision alone, and that was to somehow improve the cinnamon bun. <br>
	Today, our menu changes throughout the seasons and varies with the selection of quality raw materials we have available. <br>
	This allows us to produce a selection of quality desserts that make the most of honest and quality raw materials and our passion for what we do. <br>
	Each is made with our hands because we believe that quality desserts are made by honest people. </p>
