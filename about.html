    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>At CinnaWoman, our initial passion was for one thing: the cinnamon bun. We began by taking a traditional <br>
	recipe and wondering how it could be improved – how it could be better with texture, better balanced, better <br>
	ingredients, and better-tasting. And so, through hard work and imagination, we upgraded the cinnamon bun.</p>
   <p>With the expansion of our vision, the expansion of our menu consequently took place as well. <br>
   Thus, we started experimenting with new and unique flavor combinations and ingredients in order to <br>
   remain roots-oriented while innovating at the same time. This way, the current dessert offerings of CinnaWoman <br>
   involve a rotational menu of more than 16 dessert options, each one of which currently takes the same amount of time and attention as our regular buns. </p>
