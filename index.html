    <h2>Welcome to CinnaWoman</h2>
    <p>At CinnaWoman, we believe that dessert is something you feel, as well as something you eat. <br>
	What we initially set out with as an appreciation for traditional cinnamon buns has evolved into an environment <br>
	where tradition and innovation come together.Our cinnamon buns may be central to what we do, but they aren’t your average <br>
	cinnamon buns by any means. Our cinnamon buns are designed, enhanced, and transformed to reveal further depths of flavor and texture. <br>
    However, CinnaWoman gradually diversified from its original product offering. Currently, our menu comprises over 16 artful dessert options <br>
	that change from time to time, according to the seasons. This enables us to make the most of the freshest produce available to us, as well as to provide <br>
	our customers with the flavors that are in season—not heavy and rich when it is colder, but lighter when the weather turns. There is always <br>
	something familiar and something new when you visit.</p>
