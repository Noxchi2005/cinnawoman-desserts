    <h2>Welcome to CinnaWoman</h2>
    <p> At Cinnawoman, we believe that desserts are something you feel, not just something you consume. What we originally set out with, which is an appreciation <br>
	for traditional cinnamon buns, is now a place where tradition and innovation meet. Our cinnamon buns may be the focal point in what we do, but they certainly aren't <br>
	your ordinary cinnamon buns, not by any stretch of the imagination. Our cinnamon buns are designed, upgraded, and transformed to uncover more levels within. </p>
	
	<p>However, Cinnawoman has slowly branched out from just offering dessert dishes originally on the menu. These days, we currently offer over 16 artistic dessert <br>
	dishes that feature changing flavors every now and then based on the season. This helps us get the most out of fresh ingredients we have access to, while also being <br>
	able to satisfy our customers' cravings for seasonal dishes, although these are less heavy when it is autumn/winter, but lighter when it becomes warmer. </p>
